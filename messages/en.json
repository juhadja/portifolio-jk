      "description": "Project developed for the Global Solution - FIAP",
      "fullDescription": "What if your organic waste could generate energy and, at the same time, reduce your electricity bill? That was the central concept of our project! We created a system where the community could deliver organic waste, which would be converted into clean energy, while the amount deposited would turn into discounts on the electricity bill. In addition to removing this material from polluted rivers, part of the waste will be transformed into biodiesel. Thus, the project offers a sustainable energy generation solution that will be directed to companies and the agribusiness sector. We designed the generator in C++ on the Wokwi simulator, with a landing page explaining the project along with an electricity bill discount simulator, based on the material delivered.",
